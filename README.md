# Automated Vulnerability Scanning with Agentic AI

This project demonstrates an automated vulnerability scanning system using an Agentic AI approach. The system consists of multiple AI agents that collaborate to strategize, generate commands, and execute scans based on the client's description, without the need for human intervention.

Please note that this project serves as a rough proof of concept, and not everything might work seamlessly. It's important to keep in mind that commands or scripts that are interactive and require user input, such as `msfconsole`, may not function as intended within this framework.

# **WARNING**

Please be aware that this script will execute commands on the system without prompting for authorization. Running this script implies that you grant permission for all commands suggested by the amazing Ammar. Exercise caution and ensure that you fully understand the implications before proceeding.

## Overview

The vulnerability scanning process is automated through the coordination of several AI agents, each with specific roles and responsibilities:

- **Ammar**: Generates the initial strategy and provides input when needed.
- **Hassan**: Reviews strategies, command outputs, and the final report.
- **Kofahi**: Handles error scenarios and suggests fixes.
- **Rakan**: Monitors the command execution output and determines if additional input is required.
- **Salah**: Executes the commands generated by the agents.
- **Sajed**: Generates the final findings report.

The agents communicate with each other, exchanging information and feedback to iteratively refine the scanning process until a satisfactory result is achieved.

## Usage

```
python main.py

```

The scanning process will continue until a satisfactory result is achieved or if the agents determine that no further actions are required. The findings and outputs will be logged and stored in the `Logs` directory.

A findings report is generated at the end in markdown format.

## Configuration

The main configuration options can be found in the `main.py` file:

- `target_ip`: Specify the target IP address for the vulnerability scan.
- `scan_description`: Provide a description of the desired scan to guide the agents.

## Logging

The system generates log files in the `Logs` directory, capturing the outputs, findings, and agent interactions during the scanning process.
